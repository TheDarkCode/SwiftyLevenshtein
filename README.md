# SwiftyLevenshtein
Levenshtein distance algorithm written in Swift 4. Both a slow and highly optimized version are included.

## Usage

```swift
var source_string = "x men"
var target_string = "x mn"


source_string.getLevenshtein(target_string) // 1
target_string.getLevenshtein(source_string) // 1

//source_string.getSlowLevenshtein(target_string) // 1
//target_string.getSlowLevenshtein(source_string) // 1

//levenshtein(source_string, target: target_string) // 1

//slowlevenshtein(source_string, target: target_string) // 1
```

## CocoaPods

[CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org) is a dependency manager for Cocoa projects. You can install it with the following command:

```bash
$ gem install cocoapods
```

> CocoaPods 0.39.0+ is required to build SwiftyLevenshtein 0.0.1+.

To integrate SwiftyLevenshtein into your Xcode project using CocoaPods, specify it in your `Podfile`:

```ruby
source 'https://github.com/CocoaPods/Specs.git'
platform :ios, '8.0'
use_frameworks!

pod 'SwiftyLevenshtein', '~> 0.0.4'
```

Then, run the following command:

```bash
$ pod install
```
